The data is based on 2016 Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2) boundaries.<br/><br/>\n\nThe AEDC is a population-based measure of children's development as they enter their first year of full-time school, and takes place nationally every three years. It looks at five domains of early childhood development: physical health and wellbeing (plus three health sub-domains), social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information visit the <a href='http://www.aedc.gov.au' target='_blank'>AEDC website</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note suppression of AEDC data occurs when one or more of the following have been met:\n<ul>\n<li>Three or fewer children had been assessed</li>\n<li>Fewer than fifteen children had valid AEDC scores</li>\n<li>Less than two teachers had completed AEDC instruments for children in that location</li>\n<li>AEDC instruments were completed for less than 80% of all non special needs children</li>\n</ul>\nAdditional minor suppression's have occurred where necessary to preserve confidentiality of related suppressed cells.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease Note:\n<ul><li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a
