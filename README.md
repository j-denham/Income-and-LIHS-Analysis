## Directory Structure
* `Src/` contains all source code for our data processing and analysis. For further information, see the README in that directory
* `Datasets/` contains all datasets, both raw and processed, that were used throughout our project
* `Plots/` contains all plots that were yielded as a result of our analysis, plus others that were not included in the report


## Virtual Environment

* Best practice is to use virtual envs for installing packages. These are the commands for Bash, if you're on windows get WSL or look up the windows commands
* `$ python -m venv venv` Initialises a virtual env
* `$ source venv/bin/activate` Enters the virtual env
* `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` Installs the packages denoted in requirements.txt, which currently contains Pandas and MatPlotLib. Make sure you've ran the above command to enter the virtual env!
* `$ deactivate` Exits the virtual env
