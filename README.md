# Income and LIHS (Liveability, Inclusiveness, Health, Sustainability) Analysis

*Developed in collaboration with John Li and Mitchell O'Grady*

An analysis centred on the utility of universal basic income in remedying social issues throughout Australia. Since Australia already has social welfare
analogous to universal basic income in the form of Centrelink, the efficacy of the Youth Allowance and Newstart benefits were analysed. For an in-depth
explanation of our datasets, wrangling methods, processing, and analysis, please see `Final_Report.pdf`.
